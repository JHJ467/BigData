## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

#This will launch R interpreter and you will get a prompt > where you can start typing your program as follows âˆ’

 myString <- "Hello, World!"
 
```{r}
myString <- "Hello, World!"
print ( myString)

```

```{r}
# My first program in R Programming
myString <- "Hello, World!"

print ( myString)
```

```{r}
# My first program in R Programming
if(FALSE) {
   "This is a demo for multi-line comments and it should be put inside either a single
      OR double quote"
}

myString <- "Hello, World!"
print ( myString)
```
```{r}
# Create a vector.
apple <- c('red','green',"yellow")
print(apple)

# Get the class of the vector.
print(class(apple))
```

```{r}
# Create a list.
list1 <- list(c(2,5,3),21.3,sin)

# Print the list.
print(list1)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
# Create a matrix.
M = matrix( c('a','a','b','c','b','a'), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
print(M)
```

```{r}
# Create an array.
a <- array(c('green','yellow'),dim = c(3,3,2))
print(a)
```

```{r}
# Create a vector.
apple_colors <- c('green','green','yellow','red','red','red','green')

# Create a factor object.
factor_apple <- factor(apple_colors)

# Print the factor.
print(factor_apple)
print(nlevels(factor_apple))
```

```{r}
# Create the data frame.
BMI <- 	data.frame(
   gender = c("Male", "Male","Female"), 
   height = c(152, 171.5, 165), 
   weight = c(81,93, 78),
   Age = c(42,38,26)
)
print(BMI)
```
